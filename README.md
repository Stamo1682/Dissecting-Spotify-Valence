The aim of this assignment is to analyse Spotify's Valence metric. The datasets utilized have been collected from "Music Recommendation System using Spotify Dataset", the "data.csv" file and can be accessed at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vatsalmavani/music-recommendation-system-using-spotify-dataset/input) and "MGD: Music Genre Dataset", the "hit_songs.zip" file and can be accessed at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4778563).

Spotify has a metric known as "valence" to measure the happiness of a track. Interestingly, this metric was not invented by Spotify itself, but came from Echo Nest, a company acquired by Spotify in 2014. Despite its widespread use, the exact methodology behind the valence calculation remains unclear.

In the initial phase of this assignment, our goal is to ascertain the characteristics of the song that influence valence, using methods of inferential statistics.

The next step in this project involves the prediction of valence based on the characteristics of the tracks through the application of machine learning techniques. After identifying the optimal technique, we will proceed to evaluate this prediction using a provided test data set.
